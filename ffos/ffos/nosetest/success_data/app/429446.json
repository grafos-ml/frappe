Race against your friends in a high stakes and hilarious game of skill and physical force.\n<strong>The life of the speedy snails:</strong>\nOnly once a year does a strawberry grow in Snail Land. All of the snails desire it, but there is only enough for one snail to eat. The snail elders have decreed that in the interest of developing relevant job skills in the snail population only the snail that can type the fastest will get the strawberry. After months of training the fastest snails compete in one final race for the strawberry. This is their story. \n\n<strong>Controls:</strong>\nThis game is for two to three players, on one keyboard. Each player has a line of text to type, labeled \"Player One\", \"Player Two\" or \"Player Three\" respectively. The people playing should decide amongst themselves which player they are. To move forward towards the strawberry type the last letter on your line of text. When you need to jump you can press space to jump. To win the race you just have to type faster than the other players. It may sound simple, but remember: the other players are also trying to type as fast as they can, and you are all on the same keyboard.", "default_locale": "en-US", "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace-dev-cdn.allizom.org/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/95/95576.png?modified=1365050848", "image_url": "https://marketplace-dev-cdn.allizom.org/img/uploads/previews/full/95/95576.png?modified=1365050848", "id": "95576", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/95576/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": ["games"], "supported_locales": [], "price_locale": null, "name": "Snail's Pace", "versions": {"1.0": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1436902/"}, "device_types": ["desktop"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/429446/"}
