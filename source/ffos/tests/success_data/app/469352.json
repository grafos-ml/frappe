Production, Stocks, Project planning, POS, Payroll, Business Analysis.\nBut, how can such a complex solution function in your company, without hiring an army of experts? \nWell, this is not exactly a complex solution. Using a simple interface we have achieved to cover very complex processes, to adjust them to You, without losing functions- such as automatic booking, linking documents,  etc.\n\nOur goal was to make a simple ERP software that covers complex processes. But how?\nIn the process of developing and testing ERPAG that answer arose, therefore we established fundamental principles that are like DNA of ERPAG\n\nSimplicity\nWithout complicated forms, hidden options, complex manuals.\nNatural copying of real business processes into application enables users intuitive using.\n\nAutomatisation \nNot only typical automatic bookings! But accumulating experiences in the process of working, because ERPAG is alive service that learns and calculates, it can memorize your settings and use them in daily work. Erpag reminds you of your obligations, whether you have payments, deliveries, tasks, or important dates.\n\nIntegration\nErpag is a simple inetgrated solutution for your Company. One-time input is implied! Integration enables that once entered change is visible in all business processes, which further means that below the hood there is one unbelievable engine that enables processing, storing, prepartion for reporting, with only one single click. \nAll modern and expensive information technologies are offered in ERPAG- we have included: index search, transactional bases, analyist- datawarehouse bases, notifications, online service connectivity, back- up process, into one powerful engine that maximally saves service resources, which enables us to offer cuttingedge techologies based on very competitive prices.\n\nMorphing- User wrapping\nERPAG recognizes User's needs. By choosing \u201cRoles\u201c in ERPAG you are creating types of users that will use ERPAG within your organization. Every user has their commitments and daily routines, so it is fully possible to adjust ERPAG according to the needs of employees, and by doing that, the time of implementation is reduced for almost 90% and your employees are much more productive.  Documents, reports, statistics, notifications- everything can be adjsuted to a concrete work postion of users, by which productivity is drastically increased.\nAll application elements could be profiled according to users' needs, thus we like to say that: ERPAG WRAPS AROUND USERS.\n\nAvailiability\nYes, it is possible, on all platforms, but when we say availability, we don't think only hardware and software, but availability of the most complex ERP processes used by big companies- for You, small and middle \u2013 sized companies. We imply price availability, therefore you can afford tools that drastically increase productivity of your company. Our support is available through online trainings, free learning videos and demo examples.\n\nSecurity \nWe have implemented core security rules such as:\nSSL and advanced crypting.\nAll users are isolated in own sandboxes.\nBackup is managed daily.", "default_locale": "en-US", "tags": [], "price": null, "previews": [{"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/116/116477.png?modified=1382777197", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/116/116477.png?modified=1382777197", "id": "116477", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/116477/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/116/116480.png?modified=1382777197", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/116/116480.png?modified=1382777197", "id": "116480", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/116480/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/116/116481.png?modified=1382777197", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/116/116481.png?modified=1382777197", "id": "116481", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/116481/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/116/116478.png?modified=1382777197", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/116/116478.png?modified=1382777197", "id": "116478", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/116478/"}, {"filetype": "image/png", "thumbnail_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/116/116479.png?modified=1382777197", "image_url": "https://marketplace.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/116/116479.png?modified=1382777197", "id": "116479", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/preview/116479/"}], "payment_account": null, "categories": ["business", "productivity"], "supported_locales": [], "price_locale": null, "name": "ERPAG", "versions": {"1.0": "/api/v1/apps/versions/1496183/"}, "device_types": ["desktop"], "payment_required": false, "weekly_downloads": null, "upsell": false, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/apps/app/469352/"}
